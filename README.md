A basic colour picking game, built with JS, HTML and React with styling in CSS. 

The RGB number of the "correct colour" to be selected is randomly generated, resulting in a swatch showing of this RGB colour. The player can then select from 3 choices, two incorrect and one correct to win the game. The game can be played again by clicking the reset button. 

This is the basic version of the game- some amendments for future could be a streak counter (how many correct guesses in a row) or a correct guess counter. More styling could be added (eg. a correct guess could fill the correct RBB button green) also.
